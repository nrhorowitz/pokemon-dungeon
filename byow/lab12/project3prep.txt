Q: Can you think of an analogy between the process of tesselating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways? 
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?

A: The hexagon randomly generated could be the room, and each edge (or each connector) is a hallway that connects the hexagons.

Q: If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tesselating hexagons.

A: I would first think of writing a random room method (with parameters to specify dimensions.

-----
Q: What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?

A: A room is an arbitrary space, and a hallway connects the spaces. They are similar because I guess in a world you could randomly generate hallways, and generate rooms to connect the hallways.

Q: For tesselating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way. 
After looking at your own implemention, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab. 
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?

A: I learned that you can express it cleverly (in terms of columns) as a way of simplifying the question to reduce complexity.

-----
Q: Consider an algorithm for placing rooms and hallways on your map. 
Ideally, consider many algorithms and think about what makes some easier or harder to implement. Try and bring those ideas together into a single simple algorithm which accomplishes the task. 
In general, algorithms with as few edge cases as possible are better algorithms.

A: I think it would be very hard to do a true random seeding of the rooms, and it would be easier to have some column type format (with plus or minus some value) that puts the rooms in a sort of wobbly grid and connects them.
